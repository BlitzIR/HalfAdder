## What is Binary?
Binary is a number system that consists of two digits, 0 and 1. The binary system works on base 2 where there are only two possible numbers (0 and 1). Comparatively, the base 10 system with nine possible numbers (0-9) is widely used in measurements such as the metric system. The binary numbering system is used in electronics and computer systems and makes our technology work.

## Binary Addition
Binary addition is a unique system of addition because the numbering system only consists of 0 and 1. The maximum sums can only be two and the minimum is zero.

When faced with 1 + 1, this normally equals 2 in the base ten system. However, this actually equals zero and a one is carried over to the next set of numbers you are adding. It is like adding 65 + 65 and having to carry the one over the six because 5 + 5 = 10.

Regular Addition:
  1
  65
+ 65
  --
  130

Binary Multi-Digit:
  1   (The one carries over because 1 + 1 = 2 but two does not exist in binary. Therefore the sum is zero and the one carries over to the next set of numbers being added together)
  0 1
+ 0 1
  ---
  1 0 (in base 10/decimal format, this sum equals 2 because 01 + 01 is 1+1 in regular math.)

Binary Single Digit:
  0
+ 1
---
  1
