## What is Binary?
Binary is a number system that consists of two digits, 0 and 1. The binary system works on base 2, with only two possible numbers (0 and 1). Comparatively, the base 10 system with nine possible numbers (0-9) is widely used in measurements such as the metric system. The binary numbering system is used in electronics and computer systems and makes our technology work.

Fun Fact: In binary, 1 = True and 0 = False. This concept uses boolean logic, where there is always an identifier for true and false inputs, which results in a true or false output. It uses the order of operations and logic rules.

## Binary Addition
Binary addition is a unique addition system because the numbering system only consists of 0 and 1. The maximum sums can only be two and the minimum is zero.

When faced with 1 + 1, this normally equals 2 in the base ten system. However, this actually equals zero and a one is carried over to the next set of numbers you are adding. It is like adding 65 + 65 and carrying the one over the six because 5 + 5 = 10.

# What is a HalfAdder?
A HalfAdder is a binary addition circuit that adds the values of 0 and 1. These values are the only possible values in the binary or base-2 system. It uses electrical components and logic to execute operations which are displayed through LEDs wired to the circuit.
