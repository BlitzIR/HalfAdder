## What is Binary?
Binary is a number system that consists of two digits, 0 and 1. The binary system works on base 2, with only two possible numbers (0 and 1). Comparatively, the base 10 system with nine possible numbers (0-9) is widely used in measurements such as the metric system. The binary numbering system is used in electronics and computer systems and makes our technology work.

Fun Fact: In binary, 1 = True and 0 = False. 

## Binary Addition
Binary addition is a unique system of addition because the numbering system only consists of 0 and 1. The maximum sums can only be two and the minimum is zero.

When faced with 1 + 1, this normally equals 2 in the base ten system. However, this actually equals zero and a one is carried over to the next set of numbers you are adding. It is like adding 65 + 65 and having to carry the one over the six because 5 + 5 = 10.
